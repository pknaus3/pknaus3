### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Exlink](https://exlink.com)
- 🌱 Kinda psycho into my terminal config
- 🤔 I’m looking for people who are enthusiasts and geeks as me, it's hard to talk with me if you don't know your shit
- 💬 Ask me about anything, if I don't know the answer I'll find the answer
- 📫 Reach me over email: peterknaus@knausweb.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (I don't have random mental disorder)

  
##### Feel free to copy my .dotfiles, do you have any suggestions? Let me know, I'll be always glad to improve them
----
> I'm only pushing stable changes to my .files

Software I'm using to maintain my dotfiles is called [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io), should be compatible with any UNIX platform

----
##### Sponsoring [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as my stable editor (Slowly transfering all my stuff from PHPStorm)
