### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Exlink](https://exlink.com)
- ðŸŒ± Kinda psycho into my terminal config
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for people who are enthusiasts and geeks as me, it's hard to talk with me if you don't know your shit
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, if I don't know the answer I'll find the answer
- ðŸ“« Reach me over email: peterknaus@knausweb.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (I don't have random mental disorder)

  
##### Feel free to copy my .dotfiles, do you have any suggestions? Let me know, I'll be always glad to improve them
----
> I'm only pushing stable changes to my .files

Software I'm using to maintain my dotfiles is called [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io), should be compatible with any UNIX platform

----
##### Sponsoring [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as my stable editor (Slowly transfering all my stuff from PHPStorm)
