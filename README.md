### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Exlink](https://exlink.com)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning vim and other terminal tools to faster my development
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for people who are enthusiasts and geeks as me, it's hard to talk with me if you don't know your shit
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, if I don't know I'll find the answer
- ðŸ“« Reach me over email: peterknaus@knausweb.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (I don't have random mental disorder)

  
##### Feel free to copy my .dotfiles, do you have any suggestions? Let me know, I'll be always glad to improve them
----
> I'm only pushing stable changes to my .files (No one wants to have broken system while using it :D )

Software I'm using to maintain my dotfiles is called [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io), should be compatible with any UNIX platform
